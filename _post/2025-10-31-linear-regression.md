Linear regression is a specific type of regression analysis that, as the name suggests, identifies the linear function that best describes the relationship between an independent variable (also known as a predictor or observable) and a dependent variable (or response). When there are multiple independent variables and a single dependent variable, the process of modeling their relationship is referred to as multiple linear regression.
In physics, linear regression is commonly used to model relationships such as force and acceleration (F = ma) or voltage and current in Ohmic materials (V = RI). In biology, it plays an important role in understanding quantitative genetics and estimating breeding values. Today, linear regression is also widely used in business and industry, where it helps organizations make informed decisions and forecast future trends.
