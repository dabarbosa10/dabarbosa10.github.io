##  Presentation.
Hello! 

I'm Diego Andr√©s Barbosa Trujillo, a
Data Scientist working in Cybersecurity. I have a Ph.D. in experimental high energy physics (HEP). Prior to becoming
a full-time Data Scientist, I worked at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. My main project involved analyzing big data
collected by the CMS detector using statistical methods and machine learning for new particle searches.
Nowadays, I'm fully focused on the application of machine learning models in Cybersecurity.
