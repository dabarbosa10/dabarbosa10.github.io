Linear regression models the relationship between input features and a continuous target by minimizing squared error.

## Core idea
We fit parameters **β** to minimize  

$$ {\beta} \sum_{i=1}^{n} $$

## Notes
- Closed-form (normal equation) and gradient descent both work.
- Watch for multicollinearity and outliers.
